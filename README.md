Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

A full-stack travel agency website featuring Python, Flask, MySQL, Javascript, CSS, Flask's Smtplib mail library, and Hotels API. 
As a full-stack developer with a tremendous passion of traveling and front-end design, I programmed this travel website to find real-time hotel availablity at the world's most popular tourist attractions. 

While designing Travel.com, I took much care into the front-end design in order to provide users with a modern and attractice booking website and stand out from others.
